# HW3-PasswordGen

This project was designed as a homework assignment for University of Utah's coding bootcamp for web development.

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript documents create a random password generator. It allows you to randomly generate a password between 8-128 characters with or without special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.
Pseudo Code
The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 128 characters
The user will recieve a confirm for:
Password containing special characters, numbers, and uppercase
4 variables to include special characters, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.
The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
If, else if statement
Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.
Event listener will determine the password output with function to populate the value into the test area.

This project includes the following features:

A generate button
This will send the user a series of prompts and confirms
After user data is collected, a random password will be generated using Javascript.
A Text area
This text area will display the users password once it is generated
